## Open flags inventory

Every flag added in this pass, in one place:

### `[STATES NEEDED]`
- `components/site/home-hero.tsx` — hero body copy
- `app/contact/page.tsx` — Location contact card description
- `components/site/site-footer.tsx` — footer location line

### `[STAT NEEDED]`
- `app/book/booking-client.tsx` — confirmation step 03 video-link lead time

### `[TESTIMONIAL NEEDED]`
- `app/page.tsx` — 4 testimonial placeholders (initials + quote bodies, total 8 inserts)

### `[LEGAL REVIEW]`
- `app/page.tsx` — testimonial section intro / disclosure language

### Pre-existing operational facts that this pass did NOT verify (worth user confirmation)
These are existing copy left untouched but should be sanity-checked:
- Phone number `(833) 583-5672` (footer + contact page + contact-form confirmation)
- Email `care@veloramedicalinstitute.com` (multiple files)
- Hours `Mon–Fri · 8am–6pm Central` (contact page)
- Cancellation fees: $95 (initial late), $75 (follow-up late/no-show), $400 (Weight program early termination), $250 (Hormone program early termination) — appear in `app/legal/terms/page.tsx` and `app/intake/intake-form.tsx`
- Pricing: $295 / $195 / $145 / $180 — assumed correct per brief
- Visit counts: 16 / 5 / 21 — assumed correct per brief

### No `[PROVIDER INFO NEEDED]`, `[PARTNERSHIP NEEDED]`, `[PRICING NEEDED]`, or `[SERVICES NEEDED]` flags
The brief gave concrete provider names + credentials, pricing, and service scopes — the rewrites stayed inside those facts.

## Voice notes for follow-up edits

When filling flags, match the voice rules in `VOICE.md`:
- Operational facts get the **"bold short fact + em-dash + consequence"** pattern.
- States list, when added, should read as plain prose: "Currently licensed in CA, TX, FL, NY, and 18 other states." Avoid "Available in many states across the country."
- Testimonials, when added, should be 2–3 sentences, name a specific clinical detail (cadence, dose change, lab finding), and avoid superlatives. Initials + state (e.g., "A.M., TX") read more honest than first names.
