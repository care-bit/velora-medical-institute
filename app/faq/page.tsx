  description:
    'Common questions about medical weight management, hormone therapy, longevity & preventive medicine, telemedicine visits, GLP-1 medications, BHRT, and Velora Medical Institute care.',
}

const WEIGHT_FAQ = [
  { q: 'Who is a candidate for medical weight management?', a: 'Many adults who struggle with excess weight, metabolic health concerns, or difficulty achieving results despite lifestyle changes may benefit from physician-guided weight management.' },
  { q: 'What’s the difference between compounded and FDA-approved GLP-1 medications?', a: 'FDA-approved medications are standardized and extensively studied, while compounded versions are prepared by pharmacies and are not FDA-approved in the same way. Your physician will help determine the most appropriate option based on your individual needs.' },
  { q: 'What are GLP-1 medications, and how do they support weight management?', a: 'GLP-1 receptor agonists are medications that help regulate appetite, slow gastric emptying, and improve metabolic signaling. When used appropriately as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, they can support meaningful and sustainable weight reduction.' },
  { q: 'Are medications such as semaglutide or tirzepatide safe?', a: 'These medications have been extensively studied and are FDA-approved for weight management in appropriate patients. During your consultation, your physician will review your medical history to determine whether they are a safe and appropriate option for you.' },
  { q: 'Is medication required as part of treatment?', a: 'No. Treatment plans are individualized. While medications may be beneficial for some patients, care may also include nutrition guidance, lifestyle strategies, and metabolic evaluation without the use of medication.' },
  { q: 'How much weight can I expect to lose?', a: 'Results vary between individuals. Many patients using evidence-based therapies may experience a meaningful reduction in body weight over time, particularly when combined with lifestyle modifications and ongoing medical guidance.' },
  { q: 'Are visits conducted through telemedicine?', a: 'Yes. All consultations and follow-up visits are conducted via secure telemedicine, allowing you to receive physician-guided care from the convenience of your home.' },
]

const HORMONE_FAQ = [
  { q: 'What is bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT)?', a: 'Bioidentical hormone therapy uses hormones that are chemically identical to those naturally produced by the body. Treatment is designed to restore hormonal balance and improve symptoms associated with hormonal changes.' },
  { q: 'Who may benefit from hormone therapy?', a: 'Hormone therapy may be appropriate for individuals experiencing symptoms such as fatigue, low energy, sleep disturbances, changes in metabolism, decreased libido, mood changes, or menopause-related symptoms.' },
  { q: 'How is it determined whether my symptoms are hormone-related?', a: 'Your physician will review your symptoms, medical history, and overall health. Laboratory testing may be recommended to evaluate hormone levels and guide treatment decisions.' },
  { q: 'Is hormone therapy safe?', a: 'When prescribed appropriately and monitored by a qualified physician, hormone therapy can be a safe and effective treatment option. Treatment is individualized and adjusted over time based on clinical response and safety considerations.' },
  { q: 'What types of hormone therapy are available?', a: 'Treatment may include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or other therapies depending on individual needs. These may be delivered through various forms, including topical, injectable, or oral options.' },
  { q: 'Can women use testosterone?', a: 'In select cases, low-dose testosterone may be used off-label for symptoms such as low libido. Treatment is carefully individualized and monitored to ensure safety and effectiveness.' },
  { q: 'How long does it take to notice improvement?', a: 'Some patients begin to notice improvement within several weeks. Full benefits may take a few months as hormone levels are optimized and treatment is adjusted over time.' },
]

const PRACTICE_FAQ = [
  { q: 'How does payment work?', a: 'Velora Medical Institute is a direct-pay practice. Payment is required prior to your appointment, which is confirmed once payment has been received. Services are not billed to insurance, and pricing is fully transparent.' },
  { q: 'Is insurance accepted?', a: 'No. Velora is a direct-pay practice. This allows our physicians to focus on personalized clinical care without insurance limitations on treatment plans, follow-up cadence, or laboratory ordering.' },
  { q: 'What happens if I need to cancel?', a: 'Appointments must be canceled or rescheduled at least 24 hours in advance to avoid a late cancellation fee. Patients enrolled in structured programs may cancel at any time, with applicable early termination fees as outlined in the program agreement.' },
  { q: 'Are medication and laboratory costs included?', a: 'No. Visit fees cover physician time and clinical care. Medication, pharmacy, and laboratory costs are billed separately by the respective provider. Your physician will discuss expected costs during your visit.' },
